//! Fast-mode clip export: a keyframe-snapped stream copy of an existing MP4.
//!
//! Spec §6.3's `fast` mode. No decoder and no encoder is involved: an
//! `IMFSourceReader` hands over the source's already-encoded H.264 and AAC
//! samples and an `IMFSinkWriter` writes them straight back out. That is what
//! makes an export sub-second and lossless, and it is also why the in-point can
//! only land on a keyframe -- nothing in this pipeline could synthesize the
//! frames between one keyframe and the next.
